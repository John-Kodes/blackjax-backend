[Documentation](https://blackjax.netlify.app/) (to be added later)

A RESTful API for the React app, [BlackJax](https://blackjax.netlify.app/). With this, users can create an account that keeps track of their current score and highscore and see how they and others place on the leaderboards.

Made with Node.js, Express, MongoDB as for the database and Mongoose.
